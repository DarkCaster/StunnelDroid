Stunnel for android with user-friendly GUI

This project is in an early stage of development. Do not expect usable builds anytime soon.

Main goal of this project is to make GUI for stunnel application for my particular use case. Inspired by this project: https://github.com/comp500/SSLSocks .

Roadmap:

- (partially done) Build scripts for building stunnel binaries with android NDK for all supported architectures
- CI integration (travis ci ?)
- ...
- PROFIT !
